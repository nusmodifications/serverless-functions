# Serverless Functions

Serverless functions that NUSMods uses. They run on Cloudflare Workers.
Currently, we have two functions:

- [venue-github-hook](./nusmods-venue-github-hook/) for handling venue data updates.
- [module-error-reporting](./nusmods-module-error-reporting/) for handling course error reports.
- [nusmods-service-monitor](./nusmods-service-monitor/) for monitoring the status of our services.
